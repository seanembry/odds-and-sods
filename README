These are odds and ends scripts, and most frequently what you will see here are not finished products but
stuff to build on.

FILE			Description
apistarter.sh		A starter script for API calls. Checks if the previously obtained token is expired, if so, get a
			new one, if no token, get one, and if you have a freash token, put the various things in your
			environment (but you have to run it as . ./apistarter.sh to do that.)
